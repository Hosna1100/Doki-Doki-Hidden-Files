# Doki-Doki-Hidden-Files
The MC discovers hidden files within the game code, revealing forgotten memories and alternate paths. These files unlock new routes, character backgrounds, and secrets. Maybe Sayori has a hidden talent, Yuri’s past is more intricate, or Natsuki’s family situation takes center stage.
The mod could explore themes of identity, self-discovery, and the blurred lines between reality and fiction.
